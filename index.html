            <h2>What is Solo Leveling Ragnarok</h2>
            <p>Solo Leveling Ragnarok is the continuation of the prior series, Solo Leveling. The story begins with
                the
                sudden appearance of a gate.</p>
            <p>Gates are portals to another dimension that house dangerous monsters and creatures. To combat this
                new
                threat, certain people are granted the ability to use mana, which gives birth to the first wave of
                Hunters.</p>
            <p>Hunters are ordinary people whose bodies can store mana, strengthening them and enabling them to
                fight
                the new threats from the gates.</p>
            <p>Hunters have ranks that determine their strength. These ranks are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>National Hunter - Rivals a nation's military strength.</li>
                <li>S Rank - The highest rank a hunter can achieve.</li>
                <li>A Rank - The second-highest rank.</li>
                <li>B Rank - The third-highest rank.</li>
                <li>C Rank - The middle rank, with the most active hunters.</li>
                <li>D Rank - The second-lowest rank.</li>
                <li>E Rank - The weakest rank, barely stronger than a normal person.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The story follows Sung Jin Woo, the weakest E-rank hunter, who later gains a system that allows him
                to
                become the strongest hunter in his world.</p>
            <p>The story focuses on his son, Sung Suho, a typical university student who discovers his father's
                gift,
                the Leveling System, when a gate opens near his school.</p>
