            <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
            <p>Chapter 2 picks up right after Su-ho’s sudden awakening during a monster attack.</p>

            <p>Now conscious of the System, Su-ho begins to experience its interface—stats, quests, and abilities start
                to manifest before him. He’s overwhelmed but quickly forced to act as another wave of monsters bursts
                through the gate, targeting survivors.</p>

            <p>Despite having no formal training, Su-ho instinctively responds to the System’s prompts and defeats a
                monster with a summoned weapon. The fight draws attention from others, including high-ranking Hunters
                who arrive late to the scene and are shocked by his performance. One of them recognizes the System’s
                signature and becomes suspicious of his origins.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the System assigns Su-ho his first quest: “Survive.” With his power now unlocked and enemies
                closing in, Su-ho must quickly adapt or face death. The chapter ends with Su-ho standing bloodied but
                alive, staring at a blinking notification: “Level Up.”, and him being approched by a Stronger yet still
                possessed hunter.</p>

            <p>The mystery deepens, and Su-ho’s journey begins in earnest. Stay tuned for the next chapter!</p>
