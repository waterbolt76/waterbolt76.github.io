            <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the first chapter of Solo Leveling Ragnarok. This chapter introduces the protagonist and sets
                the stage for the epic journey ahead.</p>
            <p>The story kicks off some time after the events of the original Solo Leveling.</p>

            <p> We’re introduced to Sung Su-ho, the son of the legendary hunter Sung Jin-Woo. Su-ho is living a
                relatively normal high school life, unaware of his father’s true legacy. However, strange phenomena
                begin to occur—dimensional cracks, monsters, and whispers of gates returning.
            </p>

            <p>During a seemingly ordinary day, Su-ho gets caught in a mysterious incident involving a gate. Where
                monsters appear to have taken over some Hunters and started to slaughter the nearby area. During this
                time everyone is being evacuated and taken to safety, and while this is all occuring Suho sees one of
                his classmates surrounded by these overtaken hunters and tries to help his classmate, unbeknownst to
                him. He awakens his long forgotten and sealed power, and gets access to the System that his father
                created for him, based on a previous design. The Leveling System.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the story!</p>
