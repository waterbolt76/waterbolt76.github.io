                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Grey is the decendent of Rakan who is the Beast Monarch and similar to Sung Suho he is also a heir to
                    the title of Monarch and to become the next Monarch of Beasts. Grey was taken by one of the Beast
                    Monarchs most reverand followers to be hidden away to ensure that the Beast Monarchs lineage would
                    carry on and live on not being affected by the battle of Monarchs and Rulers.</p>

                        <p>Due to being the decendent of the Beast Monarch he is inherently gifted with enhanced
                            Strenght and Speed, but due to having his blood drained constantly, he is unable to fully
                            utilize the strenght that would typically come of being a decendent of a Monarch</p>
